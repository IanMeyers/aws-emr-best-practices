# Introduction
Welcome to the EMR Best Practices Guides.  The primary goal of this project is to offer a set of best practices for day 2 operations for Amazon EMR. We elected to publish this guidance to GitHub so we could interate quickly, provide timely and effective recommendations for variety of concerns, and easily incorporate suggestions from the broader community.  

We currently have published guides for the following topics: 

- Cost Optimizations
- Reliability
- Security
- Features
	- Managed Scaling
	- Spot Usage
- Applications
	- Spark


In the future we will be publishing best practices guidance for Applications (e.g Spark, Hudi), Architecture and other EMR features
